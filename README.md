# 100_days_of_code
After being away from programming for quite some time, I decided to start over with a new focus and determination to achieve better results. To do that, I committed to getting back into studying, and I’m currently taking the course "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp."

I found the course's approach really interesting: building one project per day over the course of 100 days. It’s a big challenge, but also a great opportunity for practical and consistent learning. I’m excited about this journey and looking forward to seeing how far I can go.
